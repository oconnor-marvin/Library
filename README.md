# Library

This is a book library I have built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I chose to build this as part of the Odin Project JavaScript branch. It is the first project in the JavaScript branch and I found the experience humbling. The main objective of the project was to learn how to correctly use object contructors. 

<h4>What I learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>I feel successful in my goal of understanding constructors and actually found this to be one of the easier concepts to understand in my project</li>
<li>The project functions as I would like it to.</li>
<li>I managed to learn a lot outside of my main objective, learning how to use resources such as Mozilla and Stack Overflow to help me (trying to rely more heavily on the former when needed).</li>
<li>I feel that through practical application and trial and error I managed to understand the <i>this</i> function much better, something I had been struggling with.</li>

<h4>What I found challanging</h4>
