# Library

Live [Demo](https://oconnor-marvin.github.io/Library/)

This is a book library I have built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I chose to build this as part of the Odin Project JavaScript branch. It is the first project in the JavaScript branch and I found the experience humbling. The main objective of the project was to learn how to correctly use object contructors. 

<h4>What I learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>I feel successful in my goal of understanding constructors and actually found this to be one of the easier concepts to understand in my project</li>
<li>The project functions as I would like it to.</li>
<li>I managed to learn a lot outside of my main objective, learning how to use resources such as Mozilla and Stack Overflow to help me (trying to rely more heavily on the former when needed).</li>
<li>I feel that through practical application and trial and error I managed to understand the <i>this</i> function much better, something I had been struggling with.</li>

<h4>Mistakes to learn from</h4>

<ul>
<li>Although very low on my list of priorities for this project, I really didn't like the styling. If anything it hurt my motivation for the project.

  In the future if I don't want to prioritise styling I will keep things as minimalist as possible. Perhaps it's an opportunity to start using frameworks to speed up the process too although that's perhaps something for later.</li>
<li>My layout felt very messy at times making it hard to keep track of my code. Things got especially messy when using trial and error.

  In the future when using trial and error I will look into using git to create a new branch. As hitting CTRL Z a lot caused much confusion.</li>

<li>I came across using data attributes too late, making my remove function operate in a way I don't like, almost making the library array redundant and if this was a real app, it would cause havoc with memory.

  I feel this comes from not understanding the tools in my toolkit well enough. I think this will come in time and I have already learnt a lot in this app to help in the future.</li>

<h4>Future improvements</h4>

As opposed to improving this in the current state it is in, I would prefer to leave this project now and treat it as a learning experience due to the formerly mentioned disorganisation of my code. I will instead use the things I have learned here to create a to-do list as a portfolio project, as I found the project to have much in common with a to-do list which I know is a must do project for Web Developers.

I might perhaps use this project to experiment with storing data in the browser although as mentioned I failed in successfully manipulating my array (although it will still be useful to use this project to learn in).
